# Coding Assistant Project

## Project Description

This project is a coding-focused AI assistant designed to help users solve programming problems and answer coding-related queries. The assistant follows a structured, step-by-step processâ€”**Start, Plan, Action, Observe, and Output**â€”to ensure clear and logical problem-solving. It can execute terminal commands securely and provide detailed explanations for each step in the process[7][9].

## Features

- **Step-by-step problem solving:** The assistant breaks down tasks into clear steps for transparency and reproducibility.
- **Terminal command execution:** Uses a `run_command` tool to execute commands directly from user input.
- **Specialized for coding queries:** Only responds to programming and coding-related questions.
- **Extensible tool system:** Easily add more tools for additional functionalities.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone 
   cd Mini-Cursor
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add your Google API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage

- Run the main script:
  ```sh
  python main.py
  ```
- Enter your coding-related queries at the prompt.
- The assistant will:
  - Plan a solution,
  - Select and execute the appropriate tool,
  - Observe the results,
  - Output a clear, step-by-step response.

**Example Interaction:**
```
> : Create a python file in the current directory with a function named sum which can be used to add two numbers.
ðŸ§  ...  {"step": "plan", "content": "..."}
ðŸ¤– :  {"step": "output", "content": "Python file is created with a function named sum which can be used to add two numbers."}
```
