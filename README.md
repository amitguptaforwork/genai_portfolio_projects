# GenAI Portfolio Projects

This repository showcases innovative GenAI projects that demonstrate practical applications of artificial intelligence in solving real-world problems. Each project highlights different aspects of AI technologies including autonomous agents, retrieval-augmented generation, and natural language processing.

## [Agent-Mini-Cursor: Python-Based Autonomous Agent Framework](https://github.com/amitguptaforwork/genai_portfolio_projects/blob/master/Agent-Mini-Cursor/readme.md)
**Python | Open AI**

This project is a coding-focused AI assistant designed to help users solve programming problems and answer coding-related queries. The assistant follows a structured, step-by-step process—**Start, Plan, Action, Observe, and Output**  (Chain-of-Thought based reasoning) —to ensure clear and logical problem-solving. It can execute terminal commands securely and provide detailed explanations for each step in the process.


## [RAG-CompanyProductBot: Enterprise Knowledge Assistant](https://github.com/amitguptaforwork/genai_portfolio_projects/blob/master/RAG-CompanyProductBot/readMe.md)
**Python | Open AI | LangChain | QdrantDB | Docker**

A "normal" chatbot cannot answer questions where data may not be publicly availalble.  Also, the chatbots and LLMs have data only upto a certain point in time.  
Here I present a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based question-answering system designed to help users explore **their own PDF data, maybe containing proprietary or latest data** using **LLMs** with context-aware responses.
